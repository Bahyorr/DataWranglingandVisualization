    "### Introduction\n",
    " \n",
    "The wrangled dataset in this report is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with humorous comments about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though, almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs currently has about 9.3 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "My data wrangling efforts cut across the three major ways which are data gathering, assessing and cleaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Gathering Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Twitter Achive Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I gathered the data by loading the WeRate Twitter archive data (twitter_achive_enhanced.csv) file provided by Udacity, uploaded and read it in pandas data frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. I loaded the tweet Image Prediction Tweet Image Prediction (image_prediction.tsv) from the url provided in the Udacity classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I used programmatic approach to load the tweets retrieved from twitter into a dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "While assesing the data, I was able to notice some observations which are Quality and Tidiness issues\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For the Quality Issue;\n",
    "\n",
    "##### On Twitter Archive\n",
    "- There are invalid dogs name e.g., \"a\", \"such\", \"quite\", \"None\", etc.\n",
    "- Timestamp column appears to be a string, instead of datetime object.\n",
    "- Some ratings are wrongly represented. For instance, Instead of 13.5/10, 5/10 was used, instead of 9.75/10, 75/10 was used, instaed of 11.27/10, 27/10 was used and instead of 9.5/10, 5/10 in the dataframe.\n",
    "- There are misrepresentation of NA value in different column such as Doggo, Floofer, Pupper, Puppo etc.\n",
    "- Appearance of unknown url at the end of some tweets\n",
    "- There are invalid huge ratings numerator and denominator.\n",
    "- Retweeted tweets and replies not needed.\n",
    "- Retweet columns and replies not needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On Tweet Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There appears an erroneous datatype (id)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### On Image Prediction\n",
    "•\tDog breed names appears to be inconsistent that is, uppercase and lowercase\n",
    "•\tThere is misrepresentation of tweet_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For the Tidiness Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "##### On Twitter Archive\n",
    "1. Appearance of 2 variables in Timestamp column which are time and date\n",
    "2. Dog stages appears in multiple columns whereas it should be only in one column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are invalid dogs name e.g., \"a\", \"such\", \"quite\", \"None\", etc.\n",
    "I resolved this issue by removing all dogs name with lower case and replace all \"None\" with np.nan in the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Timestamp column appears to be a string, instead of datetime object.\n",
    "Here, I converted timestamp column to datetime object and change the data type of id column to string using pandas.to_datetime() function\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Some ratings are wrongly represented. For instance, instead of 13.5/10, 5/10 was used, instead of 9.75/10, 75/10 was used, instead of 11.27/10, 27/10 was used and instead of 9.5/10, 5/10 in the data frame.\n",
    "Here, I was able to extract both ratings numerator and denominator from the text column, and also use astype() method to change their type from string to float.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There are misrepresentation of NA values in different column such as Doggo, Floofer, Pupper, Puppo etc.\n",
    "I used dataframe.replace() function to replace all the \"None\" strings in the dog_stages columns\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Appearance of unknown url at the end of some tweets. I was able to remove the url at the end of some tweets using replace() method in str function\n",
    "\n",
    "6. There are invalid huge ratings numerator and denominator. I used pandas query() method to extract dataframe with ratings denominator of 10 and ratings numerator <= 14. I will also evaluate the rating_numerator column by dividing it by 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Retweeted tweets and replies not needed. I performed the action of removing all retweeted tweets and replies\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Retweet columns and replies not needed. I droppped all retweeted tweets and replies columns using drop() method in pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### On Image Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dog breed names appears to be inconsistent that is, uppercase and lowercase\n",
    "- There is misrepresentation of tweet_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For the Tidiness Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "##### On Twitter Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Appearance of 2 variables in Timestamp column which are time and date\n",
    "I extracted both time and date from the timestamp object and delete the timestamp column after extraction.\n",
    "2. Dog stages appears in multiple columns whereas it should be only in one column.I used melt() method to get all values of dog stages in one column and remove all redundant dog stage columns which are 'doggo', 'floofer', 'pupper', 'puppo'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "I have been able to succesfully gathered, assesses and cleaned the twitter dataset and this has produced a useful data devoid of poor quality data issues and good for anlysis. \n",
